In this Code Editor, I am able to save and update files with various file extensions

As you can see, the line number is updated as the file's lines increase or decrease in number

I also added a Help menu with an About item
This About item will open a message box into the center of the screen with some info

In future iterations, I would like to add the following (increasing complexity):
1. Ability to change themes
2. A spell checker
3. Incorporate built-in interpreters
